Echobot is a simple starter app for the Burner Developer Connection that shows you how to a how to build a simple bot and add it to a Burner line.

### Prerequisites

* [Burner account + at least one Burner number](https://www.burnerapp.com)
* [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com) (free)

### Tutorial

1) On your Burner account, enable the Developer Connection from the [Developer Console](https://app.burnerapp.com/developer).

2) Generate an incoming webhook

3) Deploy the Echobot to your Heroku account by tapping the button below. This will install echobot as an app running on your heroku account.

5) Find your heroku url under Settings->Domains and paste it into the Outgoing webhook field on the Burner developer console with `/listen` appended to it. e.g. if your heroku url is `my-echobot-app.herokuapp.com` you would use `http://my-echobot-app.herokuapp.com/listen` as the outgoing webhook url. Make sure you add `http` as well. __you must append /listen to the url in order for the app to hear the texts it is being sent__

6) That's it, you're done! Send your newly configured Burner number a text and it should reply back. The first time you send a message it might take a few seconds to reply, so if it doesn't reply immediately be patient.
